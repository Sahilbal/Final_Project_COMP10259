        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>With a million years of evolutionary history, sea turtles are extremely old reptiles. They are essential to the functioning of ocean ecosystems and are ideally suited to marine life. These elegant animals are well-known for their extensive travels and for being essential to preserving the integrity of our waters. The health of our seas is greatly dependent on sea turtles. By consuming seagrasses and jellyfish, they act as underwater gardeners, contributing to the equilibrium of the marine environment. It is also a magical occurrence when they come to the beaches to lay their eggs. As a new generation hatches and sets out on its own maritime journey, these tenacious mothers build nests in the sand, carefully laying their priceless eggs before heading back to the sea. <br> <br>
    
            All around the world, sea turtles live in a range of aquatic habitats. To increase the diversity of the ocean, these turtles frequently travel great distances between their feeding and nesting places.Oceans provide a vast range of habitat for sea turtles. Back where they were born, they lay their eggs on sand-covered tropical beaches. In search of food and shelter, they investigate coral reefs as they get bigger. Eating small fish and crustaceans, the juveniles congregate in shallow coastal waters. En route, these amazing animals stop to rest on islands in the ocean. In order for sea turtles to continue their marine adventures for future generations, we need to preserve their various habitats, which range from seagrass meadows to nesting beaches.
